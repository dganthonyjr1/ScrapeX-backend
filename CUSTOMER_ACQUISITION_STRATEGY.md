# ScrapeX: Go-to-Market & Customer Acquisition Strategy

**Author:** Manus AI
**Date:** January 13, 2026

## 1. Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive go-to-market (GTM) and customer acquisition strategy for ScrapeX. The strategy is designed to rapidly acquire initial customers, validate product-market fit, and establish a scalable model for long-term growth. The core of the strategy is to leverage ScrapeX's own capabilities ("dogfooding") to identify, contact, and convert target customers.

## 2. Target Market

The initial target market will be focused on five key verticals where ScrapeX can provide immediate and measurable value:

-   **Restaurants:** Independent and small-chain restaurants.
-   **Law Firms:** Small to medium-sized firms specializing in personal injury, real estate, or business law.
-   **Contractors:** HVAC, plumbing, and electrical contractors.
-   **Dental Practices:** Independent dental offices.
-   **Landscaping & Lawn Care:** Companies seeking commercial contracts.

These verticals have been chosen due to their high competition, reliance on local marketing, and clear ROI potential from automated lead generation.

## 3. Pricing Strategy

A simple, three-tiered pricing model is recommended for the initial launch:

| Tier | Price | Features |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Starter** | $99/month | Scrape up to 2 directories per month, 500 business contacts, basic AI calling. |
| **Pro** | $249/month | Scrape up to 10 directories per month, 2,500 business contacts, advanced AI calling with custom scripts. |
| **Enterprise** | Custom | Unlimited scraping, dedicated account management, custom integrations. |

A 14-day free trial of the Pro plan will be offered to all new users to demonstrate value and drive conversions.

## 4. Customer Acquisition Funnel

The customer acquisition funnel will be a four-step process, powered by ScrapeX itself:

1.  **Awareness (Top of Funnel):** Use ScrapeX to scrape business directories (Chambers of Commerce, industry associations) to build a large list of potential customers.
2.  **Interest (Middle of Funnel):** Use ScrapeX's AI-powered calling to contact the scraped businesses with a human-like, conversational approach. The goal is not to sell, but to understand their challenges and offer a free consultation.
3.  **Consideration (Bottom of Funnel):** For businesses that express interest, schedule a live demo with a human sales representative. This demo will showcase the full power of ScrapeX and present a clear ROI calculation for their specific business.
4.  **Conversion (Sale):** Convert the interested business into a paying customer on the appropriate pricing tier.

## 5. Outreach Messaging

### 5.1. AI Calling Script

The initial AI call will be focused on discovery and rapport-building, not a hard sell. The script will be generated by the `HumanAICaller` and will be tailored to each industry. The key elements are:

-   **Opener:** "Hi, is this the owner of [Business Name]? My name is Alex, and I was doing some research on [business type]s in the area and came across your website. I was really impressed with [something specific from their site]."
-   **Discovery Question:** "I'm curious, what's your biggest challenge right now when it comes to finding new customers?"
-   **Value Proposition (if they express a challenge):** "I hear that a lot from other [business type]s. We actually have a tool that helps with that by automatically finding and contacting potential customers for you. Would you be open to a quick 15-minute demo next week to see how it works?"

### 5.2. Email Outreach

For businesses that don't answer the phone, a follow-up email will be sent:

**Subject:** Quick question about [Business Name]

Hi [Owner Name],

My name is Alex, and I came across your website earlier today. I was really impressed with your work in the [city/area] area.

I specialize in helping [business type]s like yours find new customers. I had a quick idea for how you could land a few new clients this month, and I wanted to see if you were open to hearing it.

Would you have 15 minutes for a quick chat next week?

Best,

Alex

## 6. Launch Plan & Timeline

-   **Week 1:** Finalize pricing, update the website with the new pricing and value propositions, and prepare a list of 100 local businesses to target for the initial pilot.
-   **Week 2:** Launch the pilot program. Use ScrapeX to contact the 100 businesses and track the results.
-   **Week 3:** Analyze the results of the pilot program. Refine the AI calling scripts and email outreach based on the feedback.
-   **Week 4:** Begin scaling the outreach. Scrape 5-10 new directories and contact all of the businesses listed.

## 7. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

-   Number of businesses scraped
-   Number of AI calls made
-   Call connection rate
-   Number of demos scheduled
-   Demo-to-trial conversion rate
-   Trial-to-paid conversion rate
-   Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)
-   Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)

By tracking these KPIs, we can measure the effectiveness of the GTM strategy and make data-driven decisions to optimize it over time.
